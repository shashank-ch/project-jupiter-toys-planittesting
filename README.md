# project-jupiter-toys-planittesting
## This repository has automated tests for https://jupiter.cloud.planittesting.com/ 

## Tools Used - 
### I used Selenium Webdriver, Java, TestNG for building the framework and testing the given testcases. Few other concepts I was able to put in are - Listeners, ReportNG.

## Object Repository - 
### I created an object repository to place all the locators used in the test suite

## Run the Code
### This code can be run through TestNG and Maven,i.e the test can either be started in an IDE or through command-line-interface using maven thus keeping the option of integrating with CI/CD open.

## Final Report - 
### You can find the final report which is generated using ReportNG here - https://github.com/shashank-ch/project-jupiter-toys-planittesting/blob/master/test-output/html/index.html 
### This report has the log steps , screenshots and one failed condition specifically inserted through Assert(fail) so as to represent how failures are handled by my code.
